# The bare domain name which represents your Matrix identity.
# Matrix user IDs for your server will be of the form (`@alice:example.com`).

# Note: this playbook does not touch the server referenced here.
# Installation happens on another server ("matrix.example.com", see `matrix_server_fqn_matrix`).

# If you've deployed using the wrong domain, you'll have to run the Uninstalling step,

# See:
#  - `roles/custom/matrix-base/defaults/main.yml` for valid options
#  - the `docs/configuring-playbook-IMPLEMENTATION_NAME.md` documentation page, if one is available for your implementation choice

# By default, we configure coturn's external IP address using the value specified for `ansible_host` in your `inventory/hosts` file.
# If this value is an external IP address, you can skip this section.
#
# If `ansible_host` is not the server's external IP address, you have 2 choices:
# 1. Uncomment the line below, to allow IP address auto-detection to happen (more on this below)
# 2. Uncomment and adjust the line below to specify an IP address manually
#
# By default, auto-detection will be attempted using the `https://ifconfig.co/json` API.
# Default values for this are specified in `matrix_coturn_turn_external_ip_address_auto_detection_*` variables in the coturn role
# (see `roles/custom/matrix-coturn/defaults/main.yml`).
#
# If your server has multiple IP addresses, you may define them in another variable which allows a list of addresses.
# Example: `matrix_coturn_turn_external_ip_addresses: ['1.2.3.4', '4.5.6.7']`
